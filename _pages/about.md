> Hi there - I'm Lucian Popescu, currently working as a software engineer at
> Harman in the Automotive Division and studying Network Security at
> Universiteatea Politehnica din BucureÈ™ti.  I created this blog to document
> various technical issues and solutions that I encounter in my everyday life
> of working with computers. My focus is on systems software, operating
> systems, compilers and programming languages.

## Misc facts

* I'm passionate about low-level technologies because they allow total control over the hardware and its capabilities.
* I love using and learning new languages - not only machine, but human ones as well. I can speak Romanian, English and a decent amount of German, Portuguese and Spanish.
* During my Bachelor's years I tried to write an operating system called [lucicOS](https://tildegit.org/lucic71/lucicos). Here is a screenshot of some things that I implemented:

**Note:** this site theme was shamelessly forked from an awesome Jekyll theme [minimal-mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/) by [Michael Rose](https://mademistakes.com/). I do not do any web development.
